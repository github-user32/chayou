To build the dictionary, follow these steps:
 1. Install Apple developer tools so you have "make" and the dictionary build tools (install XCode from App Store)
 2. Download CC-CEDICT someplace and update the Makefile to point to it
 3. Run "make" to build the dictionary bundle
 4. Run "make install" if it built correctly
 5. Run Dictionary.app to test out the dictionary (note that you sometimes have to twiddle the dictionary preferences under "Preferences" in the Dictionary.app to get it to refresh)
